Challenge to create a data repository for a library cataloging system

Database Challenge 1
You are tasked with designing a simple library management system that includes the following entities: books, authors, and borrowers.
1) Create an ERD to represent the data model for a library management system. Attach as 'part1.png' or 'part1.pdf'.
2) Write a SQL script that generates a relational schema for this library management system. Attach as 'part2.sql'.
3) Using SQL, write a stored procedure with three or more parameters that will insert a new record into the books table. Attach as 'part3.sql'.
4) Some time has passed since this system went live and now there are 50,000,000 records in the books table. Querying books is now taking a very long time and timeouts are occurring. What steps would you take to solve this problem? Attach as 'part4.txt'.
